# Model Card: ANN_model

## Model Details

**Model Name:** ANN_model  
**Architecture:** Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
**Framework:** PyTorch  
**Author:** [Your Name or Organization]  
**Version:** 1.0  
**License:** [Specify License, e.g., Apache 2.0]  

## Overview

The `ANN_model` is a simple feedforward artificial neural network implemented using PyTorch. It consists of three fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions applied to the hidden layers. The model is designed for supervised learning tasks with numerical input features.

## Intended Use

This model is intended for use in classification or regression tasks where input data is numerical. Example applications include:

- Binary or multi-class classification problems
- Predictive analytics based on structured numerical datasets

## Input and Output

- **Input:** A tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_input_features)` representing numerical input features.
- **Output:** A tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_targets)`, representing model predictions.

## Training Details

- **Loss Function:** [Specify loss function, e.g., CrossEntropyLoss or MSELoss]
- **Optimizer:** [Specify optimizer, e.g., Adam, SGD]
- **Learning Rate:** [Specify default learning rate, e.g., 0.001]
- **Training Dataset:** [Specify dataset if applicable]
- **Epochs:** [Specify recommended number of epochs]
- **Batch Size:** [Specify recommended batch size]

## Performance Metrics

- **Evaluation Metrics:** [Specify metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, etc.]
- **Benchmark Results:** [Provide evaluation results if available]

## Limitations and Risks

- The model assumes that input features are preprocessed and normalized appropriately.
- It may not generalize well to unseen data without sufficient training.
- Requires proper hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

## How to Use

### Example Code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Initialize the model
model = ANN_model()

# Example input tensor
example_input = torch.rand((1, 8))  # Assuming 8 input features

# Get model output
output = model(example_input)
print(output)
```

## Future Work

- Experiment with different activation functions and optimizers.
- Extend the model to support additional layers or dropout for regularization.
- Provide pre-trained weights for common datasets.
